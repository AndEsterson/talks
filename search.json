In a few years we might offer a completely different set of services!\nSince Kubernetes doesn’t make a fundamental distinction between short-lived jobs and permanent services, we can easily integrate e.g jupyter notebooks\nCaching logic in Kubeflow pipelines lets us cut down on resource usage, and lets researchers build clear and reproducable pipelines"

We could also fire user-level alerts to email/slack/teams/something else.\nWe can also use Kyverno to validate inputs, so that user jobs fail fast (but doing this for every Kubeflow component might get difficult)\nWe can use tools like the descheduler to enforce runtime limits (still a lot of work to implement this in a flexible way)"
